# Challenge 3 Repository - João Gonçalo

This is João Gonçalo's repository for Challenge 3. The challenge involves implementing a system that records an improvement suggested by an employee and allows that improvement to be put up for a company-wide vote.

## Project Organization
Currently, the project is organized with 5 microservices, but only 4 are functioning. There is a discovery server microservice (discoveryServer) and a cloud gateway (CloudGateway). You can perform the following actions:

1. Register an employee.
2. Search for employees by ID, name, or CPF.
3. Create a proposal for improvement via an employee (openFeing).

I am still working on finalizing the project, where a voting session will be opened, and the results will be counted.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the discovery server microservice folder and run it.
3. Navigate to the cloud gateway folder and run it.
4. Run all the other services.

Feel free to explore the individual microservices and their respective documentation for more details on how to use each of them.
